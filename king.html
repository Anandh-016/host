        <label>The introduction to your portfolio is a great way to tell your readers who you are and briefly explain what you'll be talking about. If you're using your portfolio to attract customers, it's important to give a few examples of professional accomplishments and make your introduction stand out by adding a couple of personal details. If you're writing an educational portfolio, summarize your main talking points and explain what makes you stand out. Don't forget to edit your introduction once you're finished so it looks professional!</label>

Students, freelancers, and those applying for work present their portfolios to teachers and potential employers to showcase what they’ve learned, what they’ve done in the past, and what they’re capable of doing.
